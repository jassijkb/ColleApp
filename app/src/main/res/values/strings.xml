        <h1>NATIONAL SERVICE SCEME</h1><br/><br/>
        <b>Introduction :</b><br/><br/>
        "         Popularly known as NSS, the scheme was launched in Gandhiji's Centenary year,
         1969. Aimed at developing student's personality through community service. NSS,
          is a voluntary association of young people in Colleges, Universities and at +2
          level working for a campus-community linkage."<br/><br/>

          "The cardinal principle of the NSS programme is that it is organised by the students
          themselves, and both students and teachers through their combined participation in
           community service, get a sense of involvement in the tasks of nation building."<br/><br/>
           <b>Objective behind NSS :</b><br/><br/>
           To enable the students to understand the community in which they work.<br/><br/>
         &#8226;"To understand themselves in relation to their community."<br/>
         &#8226;"To identify the needs and problems in the community in the solution of which they can be involved."<br/>
         &#8226;"To develop among themselves a sense of social and civic responsibility."<br/>
         &#8226;"To apply their education in finding practical solution to individual and community problems."<br/>
         &#8226;"To develop competence required for group living and sharing responsibilities."<br/>
         &#8226;"Gain skills in mobilising community participation."<br/>
         &#8226;"To acquire leadership qualities and democratic attitude."<br/>
         &#8226;"To develop capacity to meet emergencies and national disasters."<br/>
         &#8226;"To practice national integration."<br/><br/>
         <b>N.S.S. Moto :</b><br/><br/>
         "       The motto or watchword of the National Service Scheme is 'NOT ME BUT YOU'.
          This reflects the essence of democratic living and upholds the need for selfless
           service and appreciation of the other person's point of view and also to show
           consideration for fellow human beings. It underlines that the welfare of an
           individual is ultimately dependent on the welfare of society on the whole. Therefore,
            it should be the aim of the NSS to demonstrate this motto in its day-to-day programme."<br/><br/>
            <b>N.S.S. Day :</b><br/><br/>
            "       NSS was formally launched on 24th September, 1969, the birth centenary year of the Father
             of the Nation. Therefore, 24 September is celebrated every year as NSS Day
              with appropriate programmes and activities."<br/><br/>
